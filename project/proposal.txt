CS-12GP Project Proposal
Guild: Wise Guys

I. Wise Guys Guild Members
--------------------------
Nicholas Anderson -- World / Level
William Craig -- Enemies
Nathaniel Larsen -- Powerups, Projectiles
Ben Smith -- Main Character
Cole Tomaro -- HUD, Status & Instructions

II. Core Concept
----------------
Our guild project is a platform game in a single frame. The player starts at one position of the map and must find their way
to a key which unlocks a door to the next level. The player will be able to jump and pickup and throw items to help them avoid 
death from falling or from enemies encountered through the path onward.

III. Game subsystems
--------------------

A. World / Level : Nicholas Anderson

Description: The environment that the actors work in. Our world will potentially be platform style labrynth. This is still up
for change, but I believe the Wise Guys are going for a puzzle platform game type.

Classes include:
    1. Subworld of World: the world that the characters work in.
    2. Platform: The platform image of actor superclass that makes up worlds geometry.
    3. Doors and Background: Doors and background artwork that makes up platform and the world.
Planned Images:
    - Background artwork jpeg image.
    - platform jpeg image.
    - Doorways and gateway images.
    - Background obstacles and barriers.
Planned Sounds:
    - Doors and Gateways opening and or closing.
    - Potential Background music or sounds (potentially as a guild proccess).
Planned Animation:
    - Doorways, gates, bridges, and or obstacles opening or closing.



B. Player controlled main character : Ben Smith

Description: The player controlled character who will interact and engage with the obstacles and enemies put in their way.
They will be able to run, walk, and pick up  enchantments.
Classes include:
    1. Nebukar (the player's character): Can run, jump, and pick up enchanments. Able to interact with doors and obstalces to progress further through the game.
    2. Mover: The superclass for moving, jumping, and interacting with Nebukar and other potential characters. 
    3. Thrower: Handles throwing and projectile mechanics for Nebukar. 
Object Collisions: 
    - Nebukar can run and jump on platforms
    - Attack and destroy enemies and obstacles
    - Pick up enchantments to enhance their abilities and power
    - Take damage from enemy projectiles and other obstacles
    - Block projectiles with a shield
    - Open doors/portals
Planned Animations:
    - Nebukar running in both directions
    - Nebukar jumping in various directions
    - Nebukar throwing/shooting a projectile
    - Nebukar blocking with a shield
    - Nebukar activating an enchantment
Planned Images and Sources:
    - Nebukar idle
    - Nebukar running: series of images
    - Nebukar jumping and landing
    - Nebukar with a shield 
    Source: SpriteLib by Ari Feldman
Planned Sounds
    - Nebukar taking damage (a yelp or scream?)
    - Nebukar acquring a enchantment. ("lets get it!", "This'll show em!")



C. PowerUps : Nathaniel Larsen

Description: Items which can be found around the play map to help the player reach his goal of progressing through the locked door

Classes include:
    - Key - Must be picked up and taken to the door to pass through
    - Rock - Can be picked up to be thrown at enemies
    - Shield - Absorbs enemy projectiles for a given amount of hits
    - Health Potion - Restores the players health from damage taken from falling or fighting
Object collision:
    - player colliding with a health potion automatically consumes it iff any damage has been taken
    - rocks that hit enemies knock them out or kill them
    - player colliding with a shield makes them impervious to the next SHIELD_PREVENT damage
    - player colliding with key allows them to open one locked door
Planned Animations:
    - rock tumble (projectile motion) left and right
    - wave shrinking around player when shield is picked up
    AND/OR
    - smoke around player when shield is depleted
Planned Sounds:
    - Thunk sound of a rock hitting something
    - Glug sound of player drinking potion
    - 'tink' sound of shield absorbing impacts
